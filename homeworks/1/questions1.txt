4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -c warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems.
    
    a.) What compiler flag is used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        -Wall

    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c.
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        Well there are a ton of warnings, but it was saying that there were invalid symbols. I took this to mean that
        there was something wrong with the syntax of the code because I didn't think english characters would be an issue.
        So then that lead me to see that there was an error for the compute function. The compute function was never declared
        which obviously caused all the issues.    
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)
