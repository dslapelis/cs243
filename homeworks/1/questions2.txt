8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc -o main.c
	gcc -o circle.c
        gcc -o circle.h

    b.) What command will link the object files into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	gcc -o broken main.c circle.c circle.h

    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	Header files can't be linked to object files. They are referenced for definition by a C file...so circle.c references
	circle.h for the functions and the main.c references circle.c for the functions getArea and getCircumference.
	"gcc -o broken main.c circle.c" should be used instead.
