Assignment name is: Project 1


What did I learn?
C is hard, I'm not a good coder, I don't actually understand what a program is doing until the last 2 days.

I learned how to implement header functions and use them -- C is sort of(?) like java.

What was easy about this assignment?
The easiest part was writing the read_symbols function

What gave you problems/troubles?
Everything -- in all seriousness, printing the codeword, getting the right number of "num_valid"....for some reason my program subtracts from the num_valid. Major headache.



What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?
Nothing really...well documented, I like the ability to discuss on mycourses...



What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
I would have liked to have done better. I did my best.
